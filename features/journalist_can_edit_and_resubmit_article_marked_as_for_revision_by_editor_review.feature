    As a Journalist,
    In order to get my article published,
    I would like to be able to edit and re-submit articles marked as "For revision" by Editor review.

    Background:
        Given the following categories exist
            | name        |
            | general |

        Given the following articles exist
            | header    | subheader            | body                  | category    | status       | comment                 |
            | Top title | A breaking news item | Today at craftacademy | general     | for_revision | Please update the title |
